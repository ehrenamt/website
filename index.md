<!-- BEGIN MARKDOWN -->

Hello! I'm an upcoming computer science graduate. My specialization is in AI and geospatial applications. I'm also highly interested in software-defined radio, 5G, and embedded systems.

I am also obtaining a minor in geography. My interests in geography include global urbanism in both digital and physical spaces, and how these in turn shape policies and narratives, as well as the differences in human-computer interaction among geographies.
